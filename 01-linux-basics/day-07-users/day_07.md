# Stage 01: Linux & Git Basics
## Day 07: Users & Permissions Lab

**Brief:**

- Created and configured `devops` and `security` users, `docker` group, passwordless sudo.
- Practiced `useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd`, `visudo`
- Worked with `chmod`/`chown`: changed owner to root, restricted access (`640`), restored ownership.
- Wrote `permissions-lab.sh` script to automate all steps.

**Key Takeaways**

- Understood the difference betweeb ownership and permissions
- Learned how `sudo` and groups work
- Saw the connection Linux -> Kubernetes (ServiceAccount, RBAC)

### Result

Created users, configured sudo and groups. Practiced changing ownership and permissions with
`chmod`/`chown`. Wrote an automated script.
