# Stage 01: Linux & Git Basics
## Day 03: Working with files
 
1. **Commands Mastered:**
- `touch`: Creates files. Can be used with curly braces to populate multiple directories simultaneously.
- `cp`: Copies files. Use the -r flag to copy directory contents recursively.
- `mv`: Moves or rename files.
- `rm`: Deleted files. You must be extremely careful with this one, as it can wipe out the entire system in a single command (rm -rf).
2. **Working with links:**
- `ln -s`: Creates a symbolic link, becomes a "broken link" if the source of removed.
- `ln`: Creates a hard link (a second pointer to the same inode). Data persists even ifthe original file is deleted, as long as the link exists.
3. **File management**
- all results of the file operations are in the repository(:
### Result:     
Sucefully mastered basic file operations, link management (soft vs. hard), and acess permissions. All practical tasks and file structures have been commited to the repository.
