# Stage 01: Linux & Git Basics
## Day 02: Mastery of `ls`, `cd`, `tree` and created a Bash script to standardize the repository structure.

1. **Commands Mastered:**
- `cd`: navigating through directories, got a bit confused with the path.
- `mkdir`: creates a directory.
- `ls`: shows a list of files. With arguments, you can see human-readable sizes and hidden files.
- `mv`: moves files. And it turns out is also renames them.
- `tree`: visual represent. of directories.
- `pwd` print working directory. Nothing extra.
2. **CLI Experiments:**
- Created a Bash script to automate the repository structure.
### Result:
Fully functional script:)
